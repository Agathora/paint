 Free to all to make changes, but a mention would be nice :)
 
 Basic Paint Program i put together after i couldnt figure out how to implement it as part of another project
 http://github.com/thefoofighter/KinectTest
 
 I understand that the code is certainly not efficient nor is it the best possible way of implementing a paint program
 It was the easiest and fastest way i found that did for me what i needed
 
 Optimization issues include the List of Vector2 Objects which is going to keep adding to everytime the mouse is moved, while being clicked
 Another issue is that the reddot is being redrawn at all these positions on every frame so thats numerous instances of the same object being draw onscreen
  
 Possible resolutions would involve the renderToTarget Method, setData in a texture2D Background etc
 
 Like i said it is not effiecient and could use optimzation
 as well as that if you move the mouse too fast it will leave gaps :/
 A possible solution for this if i have time would be to get the positions either side of teh gaps and fill the gap as a straight line of red dots 
  
 Anyway i hope it helps someone sometime
 
 Kinds regards
 
 Cathal
